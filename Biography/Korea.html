    I cannot explain how excited I was to be in Korea. I was here to stay with my girlfriend for 1 month. And I wish it had gone by so much slower. It was really the time of my life. I met incredible people and made many new friends.

    <br>
    Little did I know that I would fall in love with something else in Korea, THE FOOD.

    But I cannot stress enough, if you love meat like I do(sorry all you non meat eaters!) Korea has hands down the best beef I have ever tasted. Extremely tender and juicy, and with spicy bean paste to lather on top of it, wrap them up in a cabbage leaf and you've just made the greatest tasting meat concoction in all the lands. Also, Korea's fast food delivers. 24/7!

    So yea! Korea is also home to some of America's favorite chains, some of which I went to!

    Seoul is such a gorgeous city. It is a great reason why I chose to study becoming a Software Engineer, so that I can work anywhere in the world! I definitely want to live in Seoul at some point in my life.

    I will never forget the friends I've made and the experiences I've had there!
